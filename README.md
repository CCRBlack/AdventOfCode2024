# Advent Of Code 2024
This year I'm going to work in python predominately. See [AdventOfCode2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## Day 1: Historian Hysteria
Part 1 is to simply make two ordered lists and check the difference between each pair of values.

Part 2 is to calculate the so called "similarity score" between the two lists: the sum of each value in list 1 times it's count in line 2.

## Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports
Part 1 is to count the number of lines in which all numbers, separated by a space, are consecutively ascending or descending by a value between 1 and 3 inclusive.

Part 2 calculates how many reports can be made safe if a single number is removed from the sequence.
